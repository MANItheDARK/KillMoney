## What is this plugin?
This plugin was and still is originally designed to earn money by killing other players however, I've added a way so you can also gain mob kills as well = Earn money when killed a mob.

We use the entityDeathEvent class to allow us to receive the mobs killed on entityDeath event.
We also use the PlayerDeathEvent class to allow us to receive the player death event when killed by a killer, and also functions the giving money class / function with a known popular plugin called "EconomyAPI".
This plugin also supports / is compatible with PureEntities or any working AI plugins as well.
We also support EconomyAPI as well for receiving money on kill.

## Why this plugin was originally made:
This plugin was made because there has not been that many plugins that has: Player kill 4 money, and also Mobs kills 4 money. This plugin is definately credited to kenygamer for making this plugin. Without him, this plugin wouldn't be a thing. :P
